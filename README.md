# pro_tiger - Pillar Image Gallery / Booru Clone

![alt text](https://github.com/AdmiralPuni/pro_tiger/blob/master/git-images/gallery.PNG)

Image is divided in 4 pillars ("Noticable borders when loading initially") it just looked cool, display image is compressed and compression strength can be adjusted in actions.php 

Database is used to store image directory and its name, tagging works manually through database current version tagger.php is broken but somewhat usable
